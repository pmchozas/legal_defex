# Definition extraction in Spanish Labour Law
This repository contains experiments on Legal Definition Extraction from Spanish corpora. Specifically, the object of study is the Spanish Workers' Statute. 
The experiment compares two different approaches: 1) identying definiendum and definiens both through different patterns and 2) identifying definiendum with automatic term extraction and definiens with linguistic patterns as shown in the figure below.
